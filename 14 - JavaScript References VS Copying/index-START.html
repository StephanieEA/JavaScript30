    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    let age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux' // players is updated too....
      // team is a reference to the original array, refs aren't the same as copies
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // the original array is updated
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // one day



    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: 'kobe bryant',
      age: 89
    }
    // with Objects
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99 })
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //  The poor man's deep clone
    // cap4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
